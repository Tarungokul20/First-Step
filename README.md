Hi everyone,

I'm Tarun, a 17-year-old (and honestly, an anxious one) trying to figure out if I'll even get a job in this current market. 

I've started learning Python through FreeCodeCamp and have built a few basic projects,which I've added to this repository.

I'm still figuring out how GitHub works — I'm a total rookie here. But I'm hoping that things will look a little different when I read this again a year from now.

I know no one will probably read this lol. Still, I'm going to keep building, keep showing up, and try to learn how to work with AI and tech in the process.

Just betting on the *what-ifs*.

Thanks for visiting my repo — even if it’s by accident.
